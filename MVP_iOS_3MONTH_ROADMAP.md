## Key Success Factors

1. **Focus on MVP** - Don't add extra features, ship on time
2. **Test Early, Test Often** - Find bugs early
3. **Security First** - No compromises on security
4. **Offline-First** - This is your competitive advantage
5. **User Experience** - Make it simple and intuitive
6. **Performance** - Must work on slow networks
7. **Communication** - Daily standups, weekly demos
8. **Documentation** - Document as you build

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap is aggressive but achievable with a focused team. The key is to:

1. **Stick to MVP scope** - Resist feature creep
2. **Test continuously** - Don't wait until Month 3
3. **Prioritize security** - Build it in from day 1
4. **Optimize early** - Don't wait to fix performance
5. **Plan for offline** - Architecture decision, not afterthought

**Remember:** Better to launch on time with core features working perfectly than to delay for nice-to-have features.

Good luck with your MVP! 🚀
